The root of a tree provides stability and nourishment, 
much like the root user in a Linux system has the power 
to control and configure everything. Many plants develop 
rooted structures that help them thrive in harsh environments. 
In mathematics, finding the square root of a number is a 
fundamental operation. Some words have deep roots in ancient languages, 
preserving their original meanings. Strong foundations, whether in 
knowledge or infrastructure, are always rooted in careful planning 
and experience.
